CREATE: Professional Agentic AI Vacation Planner Demo (Single Page App)

MISSION: Build a stunning demo showing 5 AI agents autonomously planning complete 
vacations in 5 minutes (vs 10+ hours manual work). MUST WOW enterprise clients.

TECH STACK:
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Lucide React (icons)
- No backend needed (mock data only)

CORE FEATURES (Build in this order):

1. CONVERSATIONAL INPUT (Chat Interface)
   - Large textarea: "Describe your dream vacation..."
   - Chat bubbles (user vs AI messages)
   - AI asks smart follow-up questions based on input
   - Handle vague inputs: "somewhere nice" → AI asks preferences
   - Sample flow:
     User: "Beach vacation, $5K, 7 days, couple"
     AI: "Perfect! What month? Departing city? Interests?"
     User: "June, NYC, food & relaxation"
     AI: "Great! Activating agents..." [Start processing]

2. MULTI-AGENT DASHBOARD (KEY WOW FACTOR)
   - Show 5 agent cards in grid layout
   - Each card: Icon, Name, Progress Bar (0-100%), Status text, Checkmark when done
   - Agents run in parallel with realistic delays (45-60 seconds each):
   
   Agent 1: Destination Scout
   - Updates: "Analyzing weather..." → "Comparing 45 destinations..." → "Top 3 found ✓"
   - Output: Cancún (96/100), Tulum (88/100), Playa del Carmen (85/100)
   
   Agent 2:  Flight Optimizer  
   - Updates: "Searching JFK flights..." → "Found 89 options..." → "Best routes ✓"
   - Output: 3 flight options (Direct $1,200, Budget $850, Premium $2,100)
   
   Agent 3:  Accommodation Finder
   - Updates: "Scanning 200+ hotels..." → "Filtering reviews..." → "Top picks ✓"
   - Output: 4 hotel options with pricing
   
   Agent 4: Itinerary Architect
   - Updates: "Mapping activities..." → "Optimizing timing..." → "Complete ✓"
   - Output: Day-by-day schedule (7 days)

   Show inter-agent messages: "Budget Agent → Flight Agent: Stay under $1,500"

3. LIVE BUDGET TRACKER (Animated Counter)
   - Visual progress bar: $4,320 / $5,000
   - Color: Green (under), Yellow (near), Red (over)

Toast notifications for key events


DEMO FLOW (5 minutes total):
1. Input (30s): User types vacation request
2. Processing (2-3min): Watch 5 agents work in parallel
3. Results (1min): Review complete package with reasoning
4. Refine (30s): User tweaks ("cheaper hotel"), instant recalc
5. Book (30s): Fake payment with card 1111-1111-1111-1111
6. Success: Confirmation screen with downloadable itinerary


KEY DIFFERENTIATORS TO HIGHLIGHT:
- "15 hours → 5 minutes" (show comparison)
- "500+ sources checked automatically"
- "Explainable AI" (every decision has reasoning)
- "Real-time adaptation" (sub-10 second recalculation)
- "Multi-agent orchestration" (parallel processing visual)


CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
Agent dashboard MUST be visually impressive (live progress bars)
Budget tracker MUST update in real-time (animated numbers)
Reasoning MUST be clear ("I chose this because...")
Refinement MUST be instant (<10 seconds)
Overall demo MUST feel polished and production-ready

Build this as a single-page React app with smooth transitions between phases.
Make it look professional enough to win enterprise deals.
